# TWEWY x OMORI x NITW Fan Game in Unity

This is my experimental game dev project combining the characters from [The World Ends With You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Ends_with_You), the aesthetics and story settings from [OMORI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omori_(video_game)), and the platformer game style and controls from [Night in the Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_in_the_Woods).

## `Assets > Scene > TownScene` Demo

## Controls
This is a very rough prototype with a lot of features TBA.

- Press the arrow keys to move
- Click the action icon to interact with an NPC
- Once in an NPC dialogue, press the `space` bar to continue to the next line
- When options appear in an NPC dialogue, press `A` and `D` to switch between options and `enter` to confirm the selection
